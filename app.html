                    for the Android and iOS operating systems. The software can be preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app store or accessed through a mobile web browser.</p>

                <h2 style="color: black;">What is app development?</h2>
                <p>Mobile application development is the process of creating software applications that run on a mobile device, and a typical mobile application utilizes a network connection to
                 work with remote computing resources. Hence, the mobile development process involves creating installable software bundles (code, binaries, assets, etc.) , implementing backend 
                 services such as data access with an API, and testing the application on target devices.</p>
                <h2 style="color: black;">Mobile Applications and Device Platforms</h2>  
                <p>There are two dominant platforms in the modern smartphone market. One is the iOS platform from Apple Inc. The iOS platform is the operating system that powers Apple's popular line
                 of iPhone smartphones. The second is Android from Google. The Android operating system is used not only by Google devices but also by many other OEMs to built their own smartphones and 
                 other smart devices.</p>
                <p>Although there are some similarities between these two platforms when building applications, developing for iOS vs. developing for Android involves using different software development
                   kits (SDKs) and different development toolchain. While Apple uses iOS exclusively for its own devices, Google makes Android available to other companies provided they meet specific requirements
                such as including certain Google applications on the devices they ship. Developers can build apps for hundreds of millions of devices by targeting both of these platforms.</p>
                <h2 style="color: black;">Alternatives for Building Mobile Apps</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Native Mobile Applications</li>
                    <li>Cross-Platform Native Mobile Applications</li>
                    <li>Hybrid Mobile Applications</li>
                    <li>Progressive Web Applications</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 style="color: black;">Native Applications</h3>   
                <p>Native mobile applications are written in the programming language and frameworks provided by the platform owner and running directly on the operating system of the device such as iOS and Android.</p>
                <h3 style="color: black;">Cross-Platform Applications</h3>
                <p>Cross-platform native mobile applications can be written in variety of different programming languages and frameworks, but they are compiled into a native application running directly on the operating system of the device.</p>
                <h3 style="color: black;">Hybrid-Web Applications</h3>
                <p>Hybrid mobile applications are built with standard web technologies - such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5 - and they are bundled as app installation packages. Contrary to the native apps, hybrid apps work on a 'web container' 
                    which provides a browser runtime and a bridge for native device APIs via Apache Cordova. </p>
                <h3 style="color: black;">Progressive Web Applications</h3>
                <p>PWAs offer an alternative approach to traditional mobile app development by skipping app store delivery and app installations. PWAs are web applications that utilize a set of browser capabilities - such as working offline, running
                    a background process, and adding a link to the device home screen -  to provide an 'app like' user experience.</p>
                <h2 style="color: black;">Difference between between native and hybrid app development.</h2>

                <h2 style="color: black;">The Mobile Application Development Lifecycle</h2>
                <p>There are two interlinked core components of a mobile application: 1) the mobile application “Front-End” that resides on the mobile device,
                     and 2) the services “Back-End” that supports the mobile front-end.</p>
                <img src="app5.png" alt="image">
                 <ul>
                    <li>Flexibility:</li>
                    <p>Stay open to change in the fast-paced online marketing space. Adjust existing strategies, tactics, and tools as changes occur.</p>
                    <li>Flawless Execution:</li>
                    <p>Achieving desired business goals goes far beyond the planning/strategy stage. You must put your plan into action, ensuring that you remain consistent with the customer feedback you receive.</p>
                    <li>Strategies, tactics and channel diversification</li>
                    <p>no internet marketing strategy is perfect. Be prepared that you may have to experiment with different strategies. This will help you engage with specific target audiences you didn't even know existed, giving you more revenue streams.</p>
                    <li>Data Analysis</li>
                    <p>Be sure to collect, track, measure and analyze all available data. In this day and age, data is critical, especially when it comes to delivering services that satisfy customers. It will also help you keep up with the competition in your industry.</p>
                    <li>Make your goals SMART</li>
                    <p>the goals you set should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and, above all, time-bound. Also, they should align with your online marketing plan.</p>
                 </ul>
                 <h2 style="color: black;">Digital Marketing Roles</h2>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Digital marketing project manager</li>
                    <li>Digital marketing strategist</li>
                    <li>Social media manager</li>
                    <li>Content writer/Copywriter</li>
                    <li> SEO Specialist</li>
                    <li>PPC Specialist</li>
                    <li>Graphic designer</li>
                 </ul>
                <h2 style="color: black;">Inbound Marketing vs. Digital Marketing: What’s the Difference?</h2> 
                <p>Inbound marketing is a strategy of attracting, engaging, and delighting consumers online by utilizing digital marketing assets. Digital marketing, on the other hand, is just an umbrella term used to represent any type of internet marketing
                     approach, whether inbound or outbound. Although digital marketing is sometimes compared to inbound marketing, it does not distinguish between ‘inbound’ and ‘outbound’ strategies. It’s more of an umbrella word for everything digital marketing,
                    whereas inbound marketing is more of a strategy.</p>
